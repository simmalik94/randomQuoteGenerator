Intro:

Created a random quote generator using simple HTML, CSS and JS.

Purpose:

Once the 'generate quote' button is clicked a random quote will be displayed from a collection of 14 different quotes.

Difficulties:

Positioning the quote container was difficult at first as margins had to be calculated to try to get it in the center of the screen.

Next time:

Using GRID and FLEX to its full capacity should allow me to position containers in a much easier way.
